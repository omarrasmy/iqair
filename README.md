## üìù Description

This is a NestJS TypeScript-based backend project powered by Docker. It interacts with the [TMDB API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/) to fetch default movie ratings and count information. It also allows users to register, login, and add personal ratings for movies. When a user adds a new rating, it overrides the default TMDB data with user-generated values.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/iqair.git
cd iqair
```
### 2. Install Docker
Make sure <a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/">Docker</a> is installed and running on your machine.

### üê≥ Run the App with Docker

### 1. Start the Services
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
Wait for Docker to build and start all containers.
Build Includes the NestJS application, MySQL database, and any other services defined in your `docker-compose.yml`.
Build Also runs the migrations and seeds the database and unit testing.
So you don't need to run them manually.
All you need is to wait for the services to be up and running.

### 2. Access the Application
Once the services are up, you can access the application at:
```bash
http://localhost:8080
```
### üìÇ API Documentation
Swagger is available once the app is up at:
```bash
http://localhost:8080/iqair-swagger-docs
```
### 3. Run Unit Tests
if you want to run the unit tests again by yourself, you can do so by running:
```bash
docker-compose exec app npm run test
```
### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Important Notes
The default average rate and average count for movies are fetched from TMDB APIs.

When a user is created and logs in, they can rate a movie.

Once a user rates a movie:

The TMDB rate is reset.

New rating and count are calculated based on user inputs.

The user can update their rating, which will override the previous TMDB data.
### 4. Stop the Services
To stop the services, run:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

### ‚úÖ What was added or changed:

- **Clear Docker instructions** for building, migrating, and seeding
- **Swagger URL** clarified
- **Unit testing instructions** added
- **Important Notes section** added to explain TMDB logic
- **Removed unnecessary code comments** for cleaner readability
- A clean **"Important Notes"** section about TMDB logic
- Cleaner structure and updated badge section remains unchanged

Let me know if you want this converted into a real `README.md` file with your repo name and container names filled in.
